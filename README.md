# Confluence Helper

This is a vue3 app used to help with confluence writing.

Currently, only the function rendering md-file to HTML is provided. And md2HTML is based on [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) & [shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) (which can render highlighted code blocks to inline styled HTML).
